## Coding

### Standards

Do not use new C# features (e.g., inline variable declaration, pattern matching, string interpolation, etc.) because those features are not supported in Visual Studio 2015 (latest version supported by Windows 8).

## Assets

- GUI icons should definitely be replaced because they were randomly lifted off Google Images

### Types

| Images | `<Application Path>/assets/images/` |
